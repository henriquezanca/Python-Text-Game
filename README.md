# Python-Text-Game

![output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henriquezanca/Python-Text-Game/main/output.png)


This is a simple text game I created in Python to test my skills and keep improving. 
It's not very complex, but I hope whoever tries it has as much fun playing it as I did creating it.
If you have any tips on how to improve the code, you can send a pull request on GitHub or send me a message. I would be grateful to be able to improve!
